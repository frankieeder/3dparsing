# orthogonal_structure_detection
Some proposed extensions to 3D Semantic Parsing of Large-Scale Indoor Spaces by Armeni et al.

See "Orthogonal Structure Detection in Point Clouds.pdf", the research paper for this project, for an introduction to the motivaton and methodology  of this project.

The main methods of the project are implemented in "orthogonal_structure_detection.py". 
To see results and get a better sense of the implementation details, explore "expiriments.py", which tests and prints the methodology against the S3DIS dataset proposed in 3D Semantic Parsing of Large-Scale Indoor Spaces by Armeni et al.
